If LDP-signaled L2VPN is configured, you MUST turn LDP on explicitely, only on lo0.0 though.
L2VPN @ Cisco doesn't work, I didn't have nerves/patience to test it thoroughly.

interfaces {
    lo0 {
        unit 0 {
            family mpls;
        }
    }
}

protocols {
    mpls {
        interface lo0.0;
    }
    ldp {
        interface lo0.0;
    }
}
